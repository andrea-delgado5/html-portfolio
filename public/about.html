<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm <b>Andrea Delgado</b>, a passionate Web Developer based in Houston, Texas. I recently graduated
with honors from the University of Houston with a degree in Computer Information Systems. Since I was younger
I have always enjoyed being creative and using technology to make things that people can use, and now, I get to do
that with coding.
</p>
<p>
I specialize in designing and building responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications.
I love transforming ideas into clean, functional, and visually appealing digital experiences. My 
favorite part of web development is combing creativity with logic by building layouts using HTML and CSS,
adding interactivity with JavaScript, and making it all work smoothly with frameworks like Vue.js and React.
</p>
<h3>What I Bring to the Table:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A strong understanding of front-end development and UX/UI design principles.</li>
  <li>Experience with modern tools like VS Code, Git, and Figma</li>
  <li>Collaboration! I enjoy working with others to bring ideas to life.</li>
  <li>Quick learning and attention to detail</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Bit More About Me:</h3>
<p>
  When I'm not designing or coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and learning new skills.
  My favorite thing is noticing the small differences made for UI's on apps and games I use all the 
  time and thinking about how it affects the users. Unrelated I love music and going to concerts and 
  if it was not apparent by now, the color <b>Purple!</b>
